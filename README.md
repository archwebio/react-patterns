# React Patterns 2022

A few React Patterns had emerged since React's inception.
This repo has a few resources on some patterns and insights on their usage.

The concepts are presented in `.md` files and examples in respective folders.

Some of the content was inspired on the works of [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/).
